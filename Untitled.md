Our solution was to design an app on your phone that would alert you when you have the virus. This app can also alert others to let them know if someone near them has the virus. If this is true, then they would know when they need to be extra cautious. If everyone can get the app, then people will have an idea of where exactly the corona-virus is, if next to them. Hopefully, if this app can get to everyone, the number of current cases of the virus will significantly go down.

The U.S. currently has over 2 million COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately, the cases aren't going down. Because people refuse to wear masks for everyone's public safety, we cannot rely on people themselves to band together to fix COVID-19. Therefore we need a new plan. Create a COVID-19 vaccine. How do you create a vaccine you might ask? Well here is a plan for developing a vaccine and how the vaccine gets out into the United States. First, you find people who have survived COVID-19 who do not have any existing health problems or genetic problems. Then you harvest the bone marrow from each of these donors. Add Antigens, Adjuvants, Preservatives, stabilizers, cell culture material, Inactivating ingredients, like formaldehyde, and Antibiotics. Once you develop the vaccine, find people who are eligible for a clinical trial. Start the procedures for a clinical trial (Exploratory stage, Pre-clinical trial, Clinical Development, Regulatory review and approval, Manufacturing, & Quality control). Once the vaccine is developed and doesn't produce long term problems, you would need to get it FDA approved. Then you would need a healthcare company to produce and manufacture the vaccine. They begin producing the vaccine and selling it at an unrealistic price, which then gives Big Pharma companies more money for their own selfish needs. This drives people further into debt which only helps the government and private companies with no regard for human life and how a vaccine is a healthcare need, so it should be much cheaper. After they begin selling the vaccine, hospitals would buy them to give to their patients who are suffering from COVID-19. Once they have begun injecting it into people, people will slowly start to get better. Once documentation is provided that they have gotten the vaccine, people will provide the documentation to their schools and workplaces. After they have been cleared for work, people will slowly start to resume back to normal life as we knew it before COVID-19.Creating a Vaccine and getting it into the world is all we need to end this pandemic. Just put it through a clinical trial, get it FDA approved, and sell it to healthcare companies. Though this may seem easy to do, a lot of work and time gets put through to make a vaccine. It takes months to get it tested and approved. but I know that if everyone does their part, we can successfully eliminate COVID-19.

For a good testing strategy, we need to rapidly test everyone in a community which has had any infections, contact trace, quarantine, and make sure that it does not spread any further. Then, we can move on to other people like professional health care and medical workers who desperately need testing.For the Coronavirus, we desperately need a vaccine, and a vaccine is pretty expensive sometimes. Since we need the right materials to make the vaccine, the best thing would be to try and test some different drugs on just a few volunteers. Then, see how it does, see how antibodies react and see if it improves any immunity. It would help the body know if the disease is there and to fight it. We also need to run it past FDA, consider extra trials, keep tracking it, mass produce it, and then we are allowed to go and distribute it fairly to everyone who both needs it and deserves it.

As of today COVID 19 has officially reached 14.1 million confirmed cases worldwide. Helping stop the spread of this disease includes following social distancing rules and finding a solution medically through a vaccine before the virus mutates. Due to the controversy surrounding social distancing in the U.S., people are not perceiving it as a working solution and instead are looking to science for a solution. A viable option for designing a vaccine and testing plan to combat COVID 19 would be by using recovered patient's plasma cells or bone marrow and past experience from SARS CoV 2 and start testing with research and development with animals first.Designing a vaccine using recovered COVID 19 patient's plasma and bone marrow would help us understand the proteins and immunology behind them being able to fight off a virus that caused so many deaths. Due to the fact that the coronavirus was caused by SARS CoV 2, we could use previous knowledge and experience to help understand what toxins and antibodies need to be used in our vaccine before the virus mutates. But because COVID 19 and SARS CoV 2 aren’t exactly alike the proteins in the previous vaccine would need to be changed and altered as developments continue to make sure it targets COVID 19 efficiently and accurately.A vaccine is developed when pre-clinical trials begin and start off using animals with close genealogy to humans. As pre-clinical trials progress with animals the vaccine will undergo change to make sure it is effective and accurate. Afterward, clinical trials begin in controlled amounts of human testing using subjects carrying the virus to analyze the recovery process. After the vaccine is tested through all phases it goes through regulatory review and approval and once it passes, the vaccine will be mass-produced and manufactured and distributed through healthcare systems. People with COVID 19 and healthy people will then visit their local physician to receive the vaccine. Quality control is when professionals assure that a good majority percentage of vaccines being mass-produced are accurate and efficient.This virus has caused a global crisis with not many people responding in an efficient and positive way and often disregarding rules set in place to help slow the spread of the virus. Because of this, millions have been infected and thousands have died. Our most hopeful solution is turning to science in hopes of a viable vaccine to save millions of lives and end this crisis.













  Concerning testing, my analysis of the situation is that, while good efforts are being made, we need to redouble and continue our testing production and distribution. Testing is the most sure and effective way available to us that allows us to keep track of who has COVID-19 and how many have it, so that those who know that they are afflicted can quarantine themselves and wait for the disease to subside, in lieu of a cure. Those who have been in contact with the afflicted will then also self-quarantine to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. For this reason, continued testing is of the utmost importance. In order to efficiently and quickly provide testing to all across the country, we must make preparations for an increased production and immediate delivery to testing stations in the most debilitated areas. Soon after, a second wave of testing supply should reach the other, less dire situations in other parts of America. Of course, supplies will be gradually replenished as well, with the aim of eventually having less immediate need for testing in most of the U.S. Naturally, to keep up with the demand that will be produced by such an endeavor, manufacturing will need to be greatly increased, and at an even better pace.  This is where the government will step in and collaborate with companies and transportation services to ensure an effective production and transportation process. Another important issue concerning the containment of COVID-19 is vaccination. To fully understand the significance of vaccinations, one must understand what vaccines are. Vaccines are essentially deactivated viruses and diseases, that are introduced to your bloodstream or other systems. It works to trick the body into producing antibodies, which are usually created after the real attack. The antibodies serve to provide immunity for the particular illness that was introduced by the vaccine. Because the disease or virus in question is deactivated or dead, the recipient of the vaccination won't feel any effects from that illness. Needless to say, some side effects will be experienced. To increase progress on a vaccine, I would encourage international collaboration and cooperation, so that all may reap the benefits of a quickly produced but effective vaccine. Though time is of the essence, in this case, we must step back and wait for the FDA and other similar organizations to approve the vaccine, or else, it may just worsen the situation. Finally, we come to the issue of transiting the vaccine. Vaccines need to be kept in special, monitored conditions, so the best way to distribute the batches would be through secure vehicles with controlled temperatures. From there, it will simply be a matter of issuing it to hospitals and healthcare workers, so that everyone may easily access the vaccine. Vaccination camps would also be useful in some areas where not everyone can go to the hospital. Overall, I believe that this would be an effective way to mitigate the effects of this pandemic.

A vaccine is a type of medicine you get at the doctors. The vaccine can potentially weaken or kill any form of bacteria that is harmful to your body. Vaccines are made of the same germs that causes the disease in your body. Even though they have the same germs the vaccine doesn't make you sick it makes you feel better. Vaccines need many ingredients to make them safe for everybody to use incase they get sick with a disease. A few ingredients are antigens, preservatives, antibiotics and many more ingredients. There are 6 steps to develop a vaccine. One of them is exploratory . The second one is pre clinical . The third one is clinical development. Then after comes regulatory review and apparel. The fifth one is manufacturing making the correct vaccine, and the sixth one is quality control. The people involved with making and marketing the vaccine is health professionals to help discover the vaccines. Manufacturers to help make the vaccine to distribute to hospitals and doctors. The government agency, and the media and communities so they know about the vaccine. Vaccines should be stored in a refrigerator in between 35 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The exact temperature for the desired vaccine is about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The amount of doses of a vaccine for everyone varies. If you have a weaker immune system you might need more than one dose. Some people need a booster vaccine which means they need the same vaccine over a new period of time just so they might not get it randomly. You can get oral vaccines and injections, but many scientists advise to get injections because the oral vaccine might be a little dangerous. Vaccines do have an expiration date. Doctors have to use the vaccine before the expiration date or something bad instead of good might happen to the patient. People with egg allergies can get vaccines but they have to be a little careful because they can get an allergic reaction from the vaccine. The FDA(food and drug administration) check the vaccines to make sure that they are safe and ready to go out to the public. If one vaccine is not right they will send the vaccines back and make the manufacturers make a new batch for the public. In the US vaccines can be distributed by a physician or hospital by ordering them from the manufacturer in other countries it might be different. Vaccines are distributed by a licensed healthcare worker or official that know how to properly inject them into the patient. Camp administrators that are listened can also give the vaccine to a patient.

​     Throughout thousands of years, there have been countless diseases and viruses, which lead to many deaths, but has also allowed the medical world as a whole to grow. Covid-19 started in a singular country but quickly spread to each and every one. This is now a pandemic and no more time can be wasted. People are dying daily, twice as much as before. Action needs to be taken right now, and as you continue to read this essay, you will learn how I plan to design a vaccine and a safe testing plan.    By designing a vaccine from patients that previously survived the coronavirus and are currently healthy, scientists will have all the resources they need to create a successful vaccine. Since the survivors now have all the antibodies necessary to fight off the virus in their system, we can use their blood to design the vaccine. We could ask for healthy people who once were infected to donate plasma, blood, or bone marrow to help scientists understand the best way to incorporate antibodies, proteins, and toxins to create a successful vaccine.    After all the stages for developing the vaccine are complete, a clinical trial will be held to ensure that people receive it. Only people that currently have the virus will be allowed to receive the virus at first. Once those people get vaccinated, a new phase begins for finding and creating something which has fewer side effects and is the safest option. We then will need to get approved by the FDA, who is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs. They ensure the safety of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation, which is crucial during this time. If the clinical trials are successful, then that vaccine will be produced and distributed nationwide. Customers will receive their vaccination by going to their physician’s office, or if Covid-19 gets worse, the vaccine will be distributed door to door.

A vaccine is a way for people to fight off sicknesses that their immune system cannot. In 2020, our world was put into lock down because of a certain outbreak called Covid-19. Right now there are millions of cases yet more and more people get sick each day and a lot of people are dying. We have not found a vaccine. Some vaccines are made of small killed parts of a germ from the Covid germ other vaccines are made of small weakened germs of Covid. There are stages of testing to make sure a vaccine is safe and it works. People who help produce the vaccines come may areas like the Health professionals, Government and schools. Like food vaccines go bad, so to help keep vaccines good they need to be kept in cool places. Some people may think that we only need one dose of vaccine then we are cured but in order to get the amount of immune system to fight Covid we need multiple doses. There are many ways to take a vaccine, as a shot or a pill etc. it shouldn't matter if people have allergies or not. To release a vaccine it must be run through the FDA (federal drug administration). If it is a bad vaccine the FDA will not approve ti but if it is good they will approve it. For doctors who buy some vaccines for their patients the place with a vaccine sends a truck load of it at the needed cool temperatures so it does not go bad. (What I would do) I would put together the most skilled scientists I can find and ask them to work together to make a working vaccine. Then I would scrape up some funding by asking the state and government officials to help pay the scientists. After that I would run their sample vaccines through some testing to see if there is one that works and is safe. If none of them work I need to ask form some more funding to continue the research. Then I would run those through testing and hopefully find one. After that I would raise a lot more funding to make enough of the vaccine that works in very large amounts. Then I would distribute the vaccine around the world and stop the Covid-19. I would distribute this by charging the enough to pay for making this in big quantities of vaccines for example charging more to the countries that are fairly rich and less to the countries that have less money.

​    Even though this virus originated in China, it has swarmed quickly into every country at a rate higher than anyone could have anticipated. As people watch, the world races to create a cure as fast as it can, but it's easier said than done. The most popular solution is a vaccine which contains a tiny portion of the virus to help you're body find a way to fight a bigger portion of it, but it can take year's to create, and if we can, we should try to contain the virus as much as we can while we work to create a vaccine. That is why we need to make sure that we are instilling simple practices around the world to help slow and eliminate transmission like encouraging a social distance of 6 feet and wearing masks in public. Detailed guidelines are outlined and updated by the CDC.    Currently, since the US has handled nothing on a federal level, many counties in the US have slowly started to ease up the degree of guidelines on their own, but I disagree with this. In Virginia, as we have started to open up, the cases have started to go up again. I feel the federal government should get more involved by helping to open up slowly and with caution around the country until cases have started to reduce and stabilize.    Once we have a potential vaccine, it will go through several tests and need to be approved by the FDA before it's given to the public. After this approval, we can start preparing for distribution of the vaccine.    We will then need to enlist our government officials to request the needed funding for production and distribution of this important vaccine. Once this is determined, we can make sure to provide the necessary equipment and resources to create the amount of needed vaccine. Once production has started and distribution is available, we can reach out to the medical community who can encourage people to see their doctor in order to get a vaccine. At the same time, we can start to help other countries in need of assistance for the virus.    While we start to open up with the distribution of the vaccine, I believe we should still proceed with caution and continue to monitor the virus closely to see if it mutates and that cases don't begin to rise.

What would you do make the weapons to fight the attack, but what if you already had the weapons it would be easier to fight the attack, because you don't have to go through the pain to make the weapons and fight the attack. That is exactly what a vaccine does. It creates antibodies or "weapons" to fight the attack. My design will create the right antibodies to fight off the virus.You are probably wondering how are vaccines created. Well we first have to know what are vaccines made of.

Coronavirus pandemic is a world crisis. We have been in a lockdown for three months and haven't seen any of ours friends. We have to wait for the vaccine to be available and have proper testing to return to normal life. Good for you this article will explain just that.First, we have to know what is a vaccine. Think about it like this. Imagine there is an attack at you front door. What would you do? Make the weapons to fight the attack? What if, you already had the weapons. It would be easier to fight the attack, because you don't have to go through the pain to make the weapon. That is exactly what a vaccine does. It creates antibodies or "weapons" to fight the attack against a virus or bacteria. My design will create the right antibodies to fight off the virus. My testing plan is to find out which drug is the most affective on humans. You are probably wondering how are vaccines created. Well, we first have to know what are vaccines made of. Killed (inactivated) vaccines are made from a protein or other small pieces taken from a virus or bacteria. Live vaccines are made of weakened germ (disease causing organism). The reason we use weakened germ is, your body will think it is under attack. So it will fight the germ and create memory cells, and remember how to fight the germ. To produce a vaccine health professionals, academia, manufacturers and private industry, government agency, media and communities are involved.We have all heard in the news lately that Covid-19 testing in USA has had false negative and false positive. Positive and negative is to say if a person has the disease or not, in this case the disease is Covid-19. Positive means a person has the disease and negative means they don't. So false positive means a person tests positive, but doesn't have Covid-19 and false negative means a person tests negative but actually has Covid-19. I would make my tests more efficient. There are many ways you can protect yourself from Covid-19. You can wash your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. Wear a face mask when you go into public. Social distance 6 feet away from people how do not live with you. Stay safe and stay healthy.
